# Advent of Code 2022

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).  
I have written my submissions in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  

You can find the solutions to each day in their respective folders. At the top of the file, I have written the relevant calls to receive the solution for that day. I have also tried to explain each solution and clear up confusing lines.

The relevant function calls to get each solution are written at the top of the codefiles for each day.
