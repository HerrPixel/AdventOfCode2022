# Advent of Code 2022

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).  
I have written my submissions in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).  

You can find the solutions to each day in their respective folders. At the top of the file, I have written the relevant calls to receive the solution for that day. I have also tried to explain each solution and clear up confusing lines.
